# IAT_all
##Built-in error penalty procedure (preferred) Each trial’s latency is recorded to occurrence of the trial’s correct response; trials on which errors preceded the correct responses are included
##IAT only 3,4,6,7 block，区分联合任务为A相容,B;不相容;e.g. 3=A1,4=A2
  - ① Designate combined tasks as A (for which faster performance will produce a positive score) and B (for which faster performance will produce a negative score). With counterbalancing, half of subjects will encounter A in Blocks 3 & 4, half in Blocks 6 & 7
  - ②Discard all trials in Blocks 1, 2, and 5
  - ③Identify blocks for combined task A as A1 and A2; those for combined task B as B1 and B2. If task A is Blocks 3 & 4, Block 3 is A1, Block 4 is A2
  - ④Eliminate from remaining data (Blocks 3, 4, 6, and 7) only trials with latencies > 10,000 ms
  - ⑤Eliminate all subjects for whom more than 10% of remaining trials have latencies faster than 300 ms
  - ⑥Compute latency means (MnA1, MnA2, MnB1, MnB2) and SDs (SDA1, SDA2, SDB1, SDB2) for each of the four blocks for all remaining trials
  - ⑦Compute two mean latency differences: B1–A1 = (MnB1 – MnA1) and B2–A2 = (MnB2 – MnA2)
  - ⑧Compute an inclusive (not pooled) SD1 using all latencies in Blocks A1 & B1; another (SD2) using all latencies for A2 & B2 (SD2). These can be computed from means and SDs from Step 6 as shown in the lines below this table
  - ⑨(B1-A1)/SD1,(B2-A2)/SD2
  - ⑩D =  [(B1-A1)/SD1+(B2-A2)/SD2]/2

绝对值：0.2 = 小效应，0.5 = 中等效应，0.8 = 大效应
